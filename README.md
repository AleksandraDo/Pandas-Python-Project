# ðŸš— Pandas Python Project: MPG Dataset Analysis ðŸ“Š

## Overview  
This project demonstrates data analysis and visualization techniques using **Pandas** in Python to analyze the **MPG (Miles per Gallon) dataset**. The dataset contains information about various cars, such as their fuel efficiency (MPG), engine characteristics, weight, and more. The analysis provides insights into factors affecting fuel efficiency and trends in car performance.

## Key Objectives  
- Perform data cleaning and preprocessing using **Pandas**.
- Analyze the relationship between various features (e.g., weight, horsepower, cylinders) and MPG.
- Visualize key metrics and insights from the dataset.
- Generate descriptive statistics and summary reports.

## Dataset  
The **MPG dataset** contains the following columns:  
- `mpg`: Miles per gallon (fuel efficiency)  
- `cylinders`: Number of cylinders in the engine  
- `displacement`: Engine displacement (in cubic inches)  
- `horsepower`: Engine horsepower  
- `weight`: Weight of the car (in lbs)  
- `acceleration`: Time taken to accelerate from 0 to 60 mph  
- `model_year`: Model year of the car  
- `origin`: Country of origin (USA, Europe, Japan)  
- `car_name`: Name of the car  

## Tools & Technologies  
- **Python**: For data analysis and visualization.  
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.  
- **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn**: For data visualization.  
- **Jupyter Notebook**: For running and sharing the analysis.
